Locate your Mendeley SQLite Library (~/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/youremail@www.mendeley.com.sqlite)
from your terminal type:
sqlite3 your-email-address\@www.mendeley.com.sqlite
Type:
SELECT COUNT(*) as entries, citationkey FROM Documents GROUP BY citationkey HAVING entries > 1;
This basically queries the table "Documents" for all duplicate citation keys.
Then,
DELETE FROM Documents WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT MAX(id) FROM Documents GROUP BY citationkey);
